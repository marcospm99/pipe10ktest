The existence of these structures is linked to the averaged Reynolds stress, uv¯: as soon as in any part of the channel uv¯ changes its sign, the structures disappear. The length and width of the rolls are found to be, approximately, 50h and 2.5h, respectively. For this Reynolds number, simulations with a domain shorter than 100h cannot properly describe the behaviour of the longest structures of the flow.},

  Abstract                 = {The history and theory supporting the idea of a universal log law for turbulent wall-bounded flows are briefly reviewed. The original idea of justifying a log law from a constant Reynolds stress layer argument is found to be deficient. By contrast, it is argued that the logarithmic friction law and velocity profiles derived from matching inner and outer profiles for a pipe or channel flow are well-founded and consistent with the data. But for a boundary layer developing along a flat plate it is not, and in fact it is a power law theory that seems logically consistent. Even so, there is evidence for at least an empirical logarithmic fit to the boundary-friction data, which is indistinguishable from the power law solution. The value of κ≈0.38 obtained from a logarithmic curve fit to the boundary-layer velocity data, however, does not appear to be the same as for pipe flow for which 0.43 appears to be the best estimate. Thus, the idea of a universal log law for wall-bounded flows is not supported by either the theory or the data.},

  Abstract                 = {{A new high-resolution code for the direct simulation of incompressible boundary layers over a flat plate is described. It can accommodate a wide range of pressure gradients, and general time-dependent boundary conditions such as incoming wakes or wall forcing. The consistency orders of the advective and pressure-correction steps are different, but it is shown that the overall resolution is controlled by the higher-order advection step. The formulation of boundary conditions to ensure global mass conservation in the presence of arbitrary forcing is carefully analyzed. Two validation boundary layers with and without a strong adverse pressure gradient are presented, with maximum Reynolds numbers Re(0) approximate to 2000. They agree well with the available experiments. Turbulent inflow conditions for the zero-pressure case are implemented by a recycling method, and it is shown that at least the initial 300 momentum thicknesses have to be discarded before the effect of the artificial inflow is forgotten. It is argued that this is not a defect of the method used to generate the inflow, but a property of the boundary layer. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

  abstract  = {Abstract Spectral methods represent a family of methods for the numerical approximation of partial differential equations. Their common denominator is to rely on high-order polynomial expansions, notably trigonometric polynomials for periodic problems, and orthogonal Jacobi polynomials for nonperiodic boundary-value problems. They have the potential to provide a high rate of convergence when applied to problems with regular data. They can be regarded as members of the broad family of (generalized) Galerkin methods with numerical evaluation of integrals based on Gaussian nodes. In the first part, we introduce the methods on a computational domain of simple shape and analyze their approximation properties as well as their algorithmic features. Next, we address the issue of how these methods can be extended to more complex geometrical domains by retaining their distinctive approximation properties.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a finite difference code for Direct and Large Eddy Simulation (DNS/LES) of incompressible flows is presented. This code is an intermediate tool between fully spectral Navier–Stokes solvers (limited to academic geometry through Fourier or Chebyshev representation) and more versatile codes based on standard numerical schemes (typically only second-order accurate). The interest of high-order schemes is discussed in terms of implementation easiness, computational efficiency and accuracy improvement considered through simplified benchmark problems and practical calculations. The equivalence rules between operations in physical and spectral spaces are efficiently used to solve the Poisson equation introduced by the projection method. It is shown that for the pressure treatment, an accurate Fourier representation can be used for more flexible boundary conditions than periodicity or free-slip. Using the concept of the modified wave number, the incompressibility can be enforced up to the machine accuracy. The benefit offered by this alternative method is found to be very satisfactory, even when a formal second-order error is introduced locally by boundary conditions that are neither periodic nor symmetric. The usefulness of high-order schemes combined with an immersed boundary method (IBM) is also demonstrated despite the second-order accuracy introduced by this wall modelling strategy. In particular, the interest of a partially staggered mesh is exhibited in this specific context. Three-dimensional calculations of transitional and turbulent channel flows emphasize the ability of present high-order schemes to reduce the computational cost for a given accuracy. The main conclusion of this paper is that finite difference schemes with quasi-spectral accuracy can be very efficient for DNS/LES of incompressible flows, while allowing flexibility for the boundary conditions and easiness in the code development. Therefore, this compromise fits particularly well for very high-resolution simulations of turbulent flows with relatively complex geometries without requiring heavy numerical developments.},
